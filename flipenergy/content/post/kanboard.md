[Kanboard](https://kanboard.org/): A self-hosted Kanban board, exactly as advertized. Has great features like automatic actions that trigger on creating tasks or moving tasks, etc. UI is clean, though a little dated. I have no idea why it took me so long to do this but I've since replaced my todo lists with a kanban board. This way, not only can keep your list of tasks, but also track which you've started on and their priority, category, and separate them out to different projects.

There's a newer board app that just came out from the folks who made Mattermost called [Focalboard](https://www.focalboard.com/) which looks very promising. As soon as a good helm charts pops up on the internet for it, or if I feel like writing one, I'm gonna give it a whirl and maybe switch.
