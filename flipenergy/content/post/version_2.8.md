[Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) is one of the most popular things to selfhost out there. Syncthing allowed me to sync directories across devices that have it installed, but I wanted a way to access files from the internet from any device. I could've just used Mattermost to upload and store files but where's the fun in that? Plus, Nextcloud can generate sharable public links so I can share files with anyone, like how I'm sharing my resume (in the website header).
